i want to use python to write a program.

I am simulating the games between many teams.

I want to let there be a Game class.

Game class includes instance variables of 
1. Team array: recording the teams joining the games.
2. number of teams
3. an array stores the winning rate of each team
4. an array stores the number of win of each team

etc...

i finally need to construct a matrix.


assume, each two teams will play one game. e.g. 4 teams will play 6 games
each row is one game.
so in this case i will have 6 rows, like, A vs B, A vs C.... C vs D

for simulation, lets assume the results, before we filling the matrix. For example, in a game of 4 teams, we can let A wins all 3 games, B wins over C,D, C wins over D, and D lose all.

columns includes, :
1. race result(who wins)
2. the accumulative win rate of team A
3. the accumulative win rate of team B
4. the accumulative win rate of team C
5. the accumulative win rate of team D
6. the prediction of this current game, base on the winning rate.


finally, for this game season, i want to know how my prediction is. i call it upset rate. i am always predicting the team with better historical record wins, and this team is favorite. a team with lower win rate is underdog. if in a game, the underdog wins,(disobey our prediction ) we prediction failed.

upset rate of a season = number of failed prediction , over, number of all games.
